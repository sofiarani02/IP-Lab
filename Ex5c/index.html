    Books are broadly classified into two categories- fiction and non-fiction,<br><br>
    <b>Fiction Book</b><br>

A fiction book is one whose content is derived from the imagination. Its theme could be inspired or could borrow a part from real life. Fiction books fall under the umbrella term ‚Äúnovel‚Äù and come in many genres.
<br><br>
<b>Non-Fiction Book</b><br>
Non-fiction is the opposite of fiction and is based on true accounts of history, real events, and facts. These have relatively fewer genres as compared to fiction.
